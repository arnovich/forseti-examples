# A 5-mode truncation of Navier–Stokes: the energy stays in its ball, then below its laminar level

Two-dimensional incompressible flow on the periodic square, kept to five
cosine modes of the vorticity: the three of T3 (`NS_T3.lean`) and their mirror
images under swapping the axes, so three triads, two of them mirror images
sharing only the forced mode. In simulation the energy settles at a constant
while the state circles a periodic orbit. The energy bound is proved as for
T3; this page keeps the exposition short and links there for the derivation.
The family theorem that covers every member is restated below.

Read the argument in four stages: the reusable energy bound, enstrophy
and amplitude control, the tighter quartic tube, and the decided requests.
Expand a stage for its explanation and individual claims.

**Proved.** From the start where every amplitude is $1$, a solution exists for
all $t \ge 0$, is unique, and its energy $E = \sum_k a_k^2/\lambda_k$ satisfies
$0 \le E \le 13$ throughout, and in fact $E \le 6$: below the laminar level
$\tfrac{25}{2}$, which no ball about the origin can pass, from a degree-four
tube around what is, in simulation, the flow's attractor, trapped under a
decrease that holds on the set only (`below6_contract`, the section before the claims). Decided by the
trajectory decider from named Lean contracts; the artifacts replay without the
solver. Its enstrophy $Z = \sum_k a_k^2$ satisfies
$0 \le Z \le 26$ throughout, by the same decider from a second named
contract, so every amplitude satisfies $|a_k| \le 6$ (`amplitude_bound`).

**Refuted.** $E \le 1$ for all $t \ge 0$: false at the start, where
$E = \tfrac{29}{10}$.

**Unknown.** $E \le 5$ and $Z \le 20$ for all $t \ge 0$.
The retained requests have neither a proof nor a refutation. Numerical runs
do not settle these bounds.

**Not claimed.** Anything about the Navier–Stokes *equations*: this is a
finite truncation, and nothing here says how it relates to the fluid, to other
truncations, or to the limit. Nothing about the shape of the flow beyond the
ball and the tube; the simulation is evidence, and no status reads it.

## The equations

Two-dimensional incompressible flow on the periodic square, in vorticity form,
keeps only the cosine modes $(1, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, $(1, 1)$, $(2, 1)$, $(1, 2)$ of the vorticity, with viscosity
$\nu = \tfrac{1}{10}$ and a constant force $f = 1$ on the mode $(1, 1)$.
Writing $a_k$ for the amplitude of $\cos(k \cdot x)$ and $\lambda_k = |k|^2$,
projecting the equations onto the modes gives, for every mode $k$ (the
projection is taken as read here; Lean checks everything from the
coefficients on),

$$ a_k' = -\nu \lambda_k a_k + f\,[k = (1,1)] + \sum_{\text{triads} \ni k} C_k\, a_P a_Q, $$

where $[k = (1,1)]$ is $1$ on the forced mode and $0$ otherwise, and a *triad*
$\{k, P, Q\}$ is three modes whose wavevectors, each taken with a sign, sum to
zero: $\pm k \pm P \pm Q = 0$. Its three coefficients are exact rationals fixed
by the geometry. This member has 3 triads.
In full, writing $a_{10}$ for $a_{(1,0)}$:

$$ \begin{aligned} a_{10}' &= - \tfrac{1}{10} a_{10} - \tfrac{3}{20} a_{11} a_{21} - \tfrac{1}{4} a_{01} a_{11} \\ a_{01}' &= - \tfrac{1}{10} a_{01} + \tfrac{3}{20} a_{11} a_{12} + \tfrac{1}{4} a_{10} a_{11} \\ a_{11}' &= 1 - \tfrac{1}{5} a_{11} - \tfrac{2}{5} a_{01} a_{12} + \tfrac{2}{5} a_{10} a_{21} \\ a_{21}' &= - \tfrac{1}{2} a_{21} - \tfrac{1}{4} a_{10} a_{11} \\ a_{12}' &= - \tfrac{1}{2} a_{12} + \tfrac{1}{4} a_{01} a_{11} \end{aligned} $$

## The system, compiled

The equations are declared once, in Asgard's language, and compiled to a
circuit whose exact field Lean draws and reads:

## What a simulation shows

The panel above integrates the compiled field with RK4 from the same start,
$h = \tfrac{1}{100}$ over $t \le 200$, and draws the five amplitudes and
$a_{(1,0)}$ against $a_{(2,1)}$. The energy, computed from that run, goes from
$\tfrac{29}{10}$ to a peak near $4.9$ at $t \approx 7.7$ and then settles at
$4.75$ while the state keeps circling: a periodic orbit of constant energy. That is evidence about one run and nothing more: it does not
enter any status.

## Derive the reusable energy bound {fold}

Triad cancellation gives an energy identity and a sum-of-squares certificate.
Each energy ball with threshold above $25/2$ is invariant; a start
inside it has a unique global trajectory under the family hypotheses.

### Cancel the triad energy transfers {fold}

The weights $1/\lambda_k$ cancel the cubic transfers within each triad.
The resulting identity is checked against this member's compiled field.

As in T3 (`NS_T3.lean`): each mode is a *storage element* and each triad a
*lossless three-port*, so summing the storage identities with the weights
$1/\lambda_k$ cancels every cubic term triad by triad. Here is one of this
member's triads, checked as plain arithmetic; its third coefficient vanishes
because $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ have the same wavenumber, so this pair feeds the
forced mode nothing:
-/

/-- The triad $\{a_{(0,1)}, a_{(1,0)}, a_{(1,1)}\}$ with weights $1/\lambda$: its three energy flows cancel exactly, and so do its
three enstrophy flows, with weights $1$. -/

/-!
What remains after the cancellation is the **energy identity**

$$ E' = -2\nu Z + f\, a_{(1,1)}, \qquad Z = \sum_k a_k^2, $$

which Lean checks for the compiled field by expanding both sides.

### Turn the identity into a trapping ball {fold}

Energy decreases above $25/2$. The ball $E \le 13$ therefore
traps any trajectory starting inside it, including the all-ones start.

As in T3 (`NS_T3.lean`), $Z \ge E$ and the forcing acts on one mode, so the
energy identity gives $2\nu(f^2/(8\nu^2) - E) - E' \ge 0$ with an explicit
sum-of-squares certificate, checked below for this member's field. So $E$
decreases whenever it exceeds $f^2/(8\nu^2) = \tfrac{25}{2}$, and any ball
above that level traps the flow forever. The level is not an artefact of the
proof: the laminar state, with only the forced mode excited at
$a_{(1,1)} = f/(2\nu)$, is an equilibrium with exactly that energy, and the
trajectory from rest along the forced mode alone,
$a_{(1,1)}(t) = \tfrac{f}{2\nu}(1 - e^{-2\nu t})$ with every other mode at zero
(a single mode feeds no triad), climbs from $E = 0$ to it, so every smaller
ball is left.
The claim below uses $13$, a whisker above.

### Connect this system to the finite family {fold}

The compiled field is an instance of the family field. The theorem applies
to nonzero modes with forcing on $(1,1)$ and an initial state inside
$E \le C$, where $C>25/2$.

The family theorem (`GalerkinNS.Family`; derivation and discussion in
`NS_T3.lean`) is instantiated here: Lean restates the library's check that
this member's compiled field is the family field at its modes, and the
theorem at $\nu = \tfrac{1}{10}$, $f = 1$ — existence for all $t \ge$ any start
time, uniqueness and $E \le C$ for every list of nonzero modes forced on
$(1,1)$ and every $C > f^2/(8\nu^2)$, provided the initial energy is at most $C$.

## Bound enstrophy and individual amplitudes {fold}

The enstrophy certificate gives $Z \le 26$ for the stated start, hence
$|a_k| \le 6$ for every amplitude. Energy and enstrophy span the diagonal
quadratic forms conserved by the nonlinear triad transfers; forcing and
damping still change them along the full flow.

### Derive the enstrophy certificate {fold}

The triads conserve enstrophy as well as energy. Its dissipation identity
supplies a second trapping certificate and a bound on each amplitude.

The triads are lossless for the weights $1$ as well as for $1/\lambda_k$
(`triad_lossless` above states both for one triad; the member file does for
every triad), so the enstrophy
$Z = \sum_k a_k^2$ has an identity of its own,
$Z' = -2\nu \sum_k \lambda_k a_k^2 + 2 f a_{(1,1)}$, and a certificate of its own,
$2\nu(f^2/(4\nu^2) - Z) - Z' = 2\nu \sum_{k \ne (1,1)} (\lambda_k - 1) a_k^2 + 2\nu (a_{(1,1)} - f/(2\nu))^2$.
The level $f^2/(4\nu^2) = 25$ is again the laminar state's, and every ball
above it traps, for every member of the family (forseti-lean's
`Family.trapped_enstrophy`; the level does not depend on the modes). What the
enstrophy ball adds: it bounds every amplitude by $\sqrt{C}$, where the energy
ball bounds $a_k$ only by $\sqrt{\lambda_k C}$; here every amplitude stays
within $\sqrt{26} < 6$ for all time, as `amplitude_bound`
says of any state in the ball the decider establishes below.

### Classify the diagonal transfer invariants {fold}

Every diagonal weighting for which the triads are lossless is a combination
of $1/\lambda$ and $1$. This classifies diagonal quadratic forms for the
nonlinear transfers, not all invariants of the full forced, damped system.

The two trapping balls can be intersected to give
$\{E \le C_E\} \cap \{Z \le C_Z\}$. A closed trapping set containing the
origin also contains the laminar equilibrium approached from that origin,
so it cannot establish the requested energy bound $5$.

K5 has a quadratic form with cross terms whose flux has no cubic part.
The checked identity still has a quadratic right-hand side: it does not

contradict the classification of diagonal transfer invariants.

## Sharpen the bound with a quartic tube {fold}

A degree-four tube contains the all-ones start, excludes the laminar
equilibrium, and gives $E \le 6$. Its decrease certificate holds on the
trapping set. The stronger request $E \le 5$ remains unknown.

Every set the global decrease can trap contains every equilibrium: at an
equilibrium the rate is zero, so $V' \le \alpha(C' - V)$ forces $V \le C'$ there.
The laminar state $(0, 0, 5, 0, 0)$ is an equilibrium (`laminar_equilibrium`),
so no such set, whatever its weights or centre, has $\max E$ below
$\tfrac{25}{2}$. A set that excludes it needs a decrease that holds *on the set
only*, which the library takes for a general polynomial $V$ (`PolynomialTrapping`,
by a barrier lemma).

Where this flow goes is not a point. In simulation (evidence, never a status)
the start settles on a **rotating wave**: the forced amplitude sits at
$a_{11} \approx 1.317$ while $a_{10} + i\,a_{01}$ and $a_{21} + i\,a_{12}$
keep constant moduli ($1.907$ and $1.101$) and rotate at equal and opposite
rates, period about $22.9$, with $E \approx 4.748$ constant — a relative
equilibrium of the field's rotation symmetry. The search found no ellipsoid
that traps it; it found (the design study's spike, task 213) a thin
**degree-four tube**
$V \le 1$ around it that holds the start, excludes the laminar point
($V \approx 500$ there) and lies inside $E \le 6$, on which the decrease holds
by an explicit degree-six sum of squares with a multiplier $\sigma \ge 0$. All
of it is rational and every identity is `ring`; the library states the
contract `below6_contract`, and the decider cites it below.

## Inspect the decided trajectory contracts {fold}

The queries certify energy bound $13$ and the sharper bound $6$,
and enstrophy bound $26$, from the all-ones start at time zero. Energy
bound $1$ is refuted; $E \le 5$ and $Z \le 20$ remain unknown.
Unknown requests may have no claim card, so claim counts do not list every
unresolved query.

Existence for all time, uniqueness and the sets come from the library's
trapping theorems: the ball from the general one that traps the Lorenz system
(`Lorenz.lean`), the tube from its polynomial variant with the decrease on the
set, both by clamping the field to a box, solving on every $[0, n]$, gluing,
and fencing at the boundary. Every claim below is decided against the compiled

## Scope and unresolved bounds

These are statements about the compiled finite ODE at the stated viscosity,
forcing and initial state. They establish no approximation or limiting
theorem for the Navier–Stokes PDE. Simulations guide the questions but are
not proofs. The requests $E \le 5$ and $Z \le 20$ remain unknown;
their absence from claim counts does not make them settled.
