"""Recheck every notebook with the installed Glitnir and save what it records.

For each configured notebook, in file order, this drives Glitnir's own preview
service (`glitnir.service.preview.SourcePreviewService`) the way the
editor does, so that ``<Notebook>.glitnir.json`` ends up current:

1. Every decision whose saved entry is out of date is decided again. When the
   directive is followed by the block an earlier decision inserted
   (``namespace Decided_<name>`` ... ``end Decided_<name>``), that block is
   taken out first and the new checked block is inserted in its place, exactly
   as the editor's Accept inserts it. Decisions never accepted get only their
   saved entry refreshed: no new source is added.
2. Every evidence card whose saved run is out of date is run again.
3. The saved notebook is checked; the check saves its claim results.
4. Every ``-- @view`` is drawn; drawings made in a known environment are saved
   in the results, so the gallery shows them without Lean.

A summary per notebook (claim counts and every status change against the
results found before, the decisions and evidence run, the views saved) is
written as ``report.json`` and ``report.md`` to the report directory.

Usage::

    python -m scripts.recheck [--only NAME ...] [--force-decision NAME] [--report DIR] [--no-runs]

Lean, the notebooks' Lake build and the Glitnir backend with the Forseti
provider (and Z3, for decisions) must be installed. Exits 1 when any notebook
could not be checked, withheld claims, or left a decision, evidence card or
view out of date; the report says which.
